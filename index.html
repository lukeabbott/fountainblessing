        <h2>We Believe</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <h3>Holy Scriptures</h3>
        <p>We believe the Holy Scriptures of the old and new testaments to be the inspired word of God.  The final authority for faith and life, inerrant in the original writings infallible and God-breathed.  (2Tim. 3:16,17 – 2 Pet. 1:20,21 – Matt. 5:18 – John 16:12,13)</p>
        <h3>God Head</h3>
        <p>We believe in the triune God, eternally existing in three persons – Father, Son and Holy Spirit – Co eternal in being co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory and having the same attributes and perfections.  (Deut.6:4 – 2 Corth. 13:14)</p>
        <h3>The Person and Work of Christ</h3>
        <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the virgin Mary in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men.  (John 1:1,2,14 – Luke 1:35)</p>
        <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for all mankind as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice to accomplish the redemption and justification of all who trust in Him, and is assured by his literal and physical resurrection from the dead. (Romans 3:24, 25 – 1 Pet. 2:24 – Eph. 1:7 – 1 Pet 1:3-5)</p>
        <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended into heaven and is now exalted at the right hand of God, where as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of representative, intercessor and advocate.  (Acts 9:11 – Heb. 9:25, 7:25 – Rom. 8:34 – 1 John 1:2)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <h3>The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit</h3>
        <p>We believe the Holy Spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and that He is the supernatural agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption.  (John 16:8-11 – 2 Corth. 1:6 – 1Corth. 12:12-14 – Rom. 8:9 – Eph. 1:13, 14)</p>
        <p>We believe He is the Divine Teacher who guides believers into all truth, and that it is the privilege and duty of all saved to be filled with the Spirit.  (John 16:13 – 1John 2:20, 27 – Eph 5:18)</p>
        <h3>The Total Depravity of Man</h3>
        <p>We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that in Adam’s sin the race fell, inherited a sinful nature and became alienated from God, and that man is totally depraved and of himself utterly unable to remedy his lost condition.  (Gen 1:26, 27 – Rom. 3:22, 23 – Eph 2:1-3, 12)</p>
        <h3>SALVATION</h3>
        <p>We believe that salvation is a gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of sins.  (Eph 2:5-10 – John 1:12 – Eph. 1:7 – 1 Pet. 1:18, 19)</p>
